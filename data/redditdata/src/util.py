    Given a function f: A->B that expects to operate on a field of a dict,

    When building a processing pipeline, some functions need to manipulate
    dictionaries representing comments, and many functions need to specifically
    manipulate a comment's body text, for example. This functions allows
    functions that operate on strings to be turned into functions that take and
    return comments but operate on a field of the dictionary using the original
    function. By default, the 'body' field is used.

    So, for example, `wrap(str.upper)({'body': 'hello'}) == {'body': 'HELLO'}`.
    Here `str.upper` is a function operating on strings, and `wrap(str.upper)`
    is a function operating on comments (using `str.upper`).

    By specifying a key, f can also operate on a different field of the comment.
    Note that the returned function will mutate its input comment in place and
    then return this modified version of the comment as output.
